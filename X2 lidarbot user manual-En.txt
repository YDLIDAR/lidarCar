All slaves will receive the signal from the master.
-When COCO enters the broadcast mode, repeat STEP 1  to see the current broadcast host on the screen.  Button A/C means up and down, and button B means to confirm. The Mac address of the host can be viewed from the mobile phone or computer near Wi-Fi. The host starts with lidar and is followed by the host Mac address.
